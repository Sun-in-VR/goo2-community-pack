Community driven assets pack for World of Goo 2.

# How to install

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file
2. Extract the contents somewhere readily accesible (i.e. your desktop)
3. Locate your World of Goo 2 installation folder
4. Find the folder named `res.goo` (It should be under `World of Goo 2/game/res.goo`). Make a backup copy somewhere outside of `game`, and rename the original to `res.zip`
5. Extract `res.zip`. Ensure the correct file structure: `World of Goo 2/game/res/...`.
6. Merge the downloaded `res` folder into the one that you extracted from the game. You can do this by moving the downloaded `res` folder into the `World of Goo 2/game` folder. When asked, chose to replace all files.
7. You should be good to go!
